/*
Topic: Operator overloading.
Write a C++ program to define a class Vector with private data members x and y (both float).
Overload the + operator to add two Vector objects (adding respective x and y components) and return a new Vector object.
Overload the << operator to print a Vector object in the format "(x, y)".
Demonstrate in main() by adding two Vector objects and printing the result. Use <iostream>.
(Expected Output Example: Input v1(1.5, 2.5), v2(3.0, 4.0) â†’ Sum: (4.5, 6.5))
