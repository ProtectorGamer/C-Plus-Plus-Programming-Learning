/*
Topic: File handling (searching in a text file).
Write a C++ program to define a class Employee with private data members empId (int) and salary (float). 
Provide a member function writeToFile() to write an Employee objectâ€™s data to a text file "employees.txt" 
in the format "empId salary" (e.g., "101 50000"). Provide a static member function searchById(int id) to read 
the file and display the Employee data for the given empId in the format "Employee ID: X, Salary: Y". If not found, 
print "Employee with ID X not found". 
Demonstrate in main() by writing two Employee objects to the file and searching for one empId.
Use <fstream> and <iostream>.
