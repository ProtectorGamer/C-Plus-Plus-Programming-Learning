/*
Topic: Classes and objects.
Write a C++ program to define a class Book with private data members bookId (int) and price (float). 
Provide a default constructor (sets bookId to 0 and price to 0.0) and a parameterized constructor to initialize the members. 
Include a member function display() to print the book details in the format "Book ID: X, Price: Y". 
Demonstrate in main() by creating two Book objects (one using each constructor) and calling display() for both. Use <iostream>.
(Expected Output Example: Input b1(101, 250.50), b2() â†’ Book ID: 101, Price: 250.50, Book ID: 0, Price: 0)
